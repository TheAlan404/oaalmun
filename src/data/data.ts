Questions like these have been frequently asked, particularly after recent events such as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the Ukraine-Russia war. In the OAALMUN'24 Legal Committee, you will propose new laws against terrorists and take global action against the many terrorist organizations that exist in the world.`,

The UNSC's authority to deploy military force underscores its key role in addressing global threats, though discussions continue about its structure and representation.

        In OAALMUN'24, the delegates will be discussing the “Mozambique insurgency". The Mozambique insurgency refers to the ongoing conflict in the Cabo Delgado region, marked by violence, displacement, and humanitarian crisis since 2017. Militant groups, mostly Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama (ASWJ) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have started a rebellion against the Mozambican government, leading to general atrocities, including attacks on villages, abductions, and displacement of the civilian population. The insurgency has fueled a severe humanitarian crisis, with thousands displaced and facing bad conditions. The region's significance in the energy sector adds complexity, requiring international attention and collaborative efforts to address the multifaceted challenges and alleviate the suffering of the affected population. We wish all the delegates the best chance in finding  resolutions to this fatal issue for the benefit of those affected.`,
